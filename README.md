# Boston_pedestrian_navigation_research_project

This repo contains some notebooks of the research work I did for my graduation. This work was done in CentraleSupelec and with the collaboration of MIT Senseable City Lab.
I will not be able to show all of the work that I did due to confidentiality ethics.
This repo will be updated.

-Creating SF data.ipynb : Creating the shortest paths in a tip dataset in San Francisco+Miscellaneous work on graphs, GeoDataFrames and GeoJSON.
-Extract OSM Metadata.ipynb : How I managed to extract urban element data from OSM using the OverpassAPI.
-Scaling - Projection - Matching.ipynb : Matching street elements to their corresponding streets in the city network (graph). Each element is matched to its closest street using the great circle distance.
-Visualizing Boston and San Francisco.ipynb : Data Visualization for Boston and SF. Starting from the length distribution to maps of trip density and urban element concentration in both cities.

In this project I used several python tools concerning graphs, GIS data, linear algebra, statistics, machine learning, data visualization and multiprocessing.
